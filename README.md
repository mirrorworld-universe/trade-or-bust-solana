# Tech Stack

## **Technologies Used**

In the project, we have adopted the following technologies:

- Solana On-Chain support: In the project, we have developed the on-chain SDK for trade-or-bust using Rust with the support of Solana (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mirrorworld/solana.tradeorburst). This SDK is used to support the game's data and core logic.
- CocosCreator: We have utilized CocosCreator as our frontend development tool to enhance the development efficiency and achieve impressive visual effects.
- Zero-Knowledge Proof for Enhanced Gameplay: In the core game content - forced trading part, we plan to use Zero-Knowledge Proof to encrypt the trading content to increase the fun and challenge of the game.

## **APIs for Frontend-Backend Interaction**

The project encompasses over a dozen APIs that facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and on-chain SDK. These APIs handle important operations and actions required for the game mechanics and player interactions.

They are

```
joinGame,askStart,move,pickAsset,pickFund,trade,acceptTrade,rejectTrade,finishGame
```

We have implemented these interfaces preliminarily, but in a real environment, the situation may become more complex. In subsequent development, we will incorporate additional logic to handle various unexpected scenarios, such as insufficient tokens.

## **Enhanced Gameplay with Zero-Knowledge Proof**

In the core gameplay content, specifically the mandatory trading aspect, we have planned to incorporate Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to encrypt transactional content. This addition aims to enhance the game's overall excitement, challenge, and security by introducing cryptographic techniques to ensure privacy and validate player actions.
